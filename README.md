## 📦 The Collection

This pack is designed to grow. Currently, it includes two core tools focused on UX and Efficiency.

---

### 1. Batch Selector (Control)
**"Filter your generations like a Pro."**
The Batch Selector replaces the need for complex preview-and-cancel workflows. It pauses execution, allowing you to visually select the best candidates from a batch before passing them downstream.

#### Features
*   **Native Canvas UI:** A responsive, pixel-perfect interface drawn directly in the node graph. No floating HTML windows.
*   **Intelligent Layout:** Automatically adjusts the grid to fit your image aspect ratios (Portrait/Landscape) without distortion.
*   **Zero-Overhead:** Only passes the selected images to the next node (Upscaler, Saver, etc.), saving massive GPU time.
*   **Workflow Control:** Includes a dedicated **CANCEL** button to instantly stop the workflow if the batch is unsatisfactory.

> **Node Name:** `Batch Selector`
> **Menu:** `3R3BOS`

### 2. Image Comparer Slider (Visualization)
**"The ultimate A/B testing tool."**
A high-performance slider to compare Checkpoints, LoRAs, or "Before/After" Upscaling results with zero latency.

#### 🎥 Slider Demo

*   **Dynamic Inputs:** Automatically creates up to 20 input slots as you connect wires.
*   **Zero-Lag:** Client-side caching ensures 60fps scrubbing.
*   **Auto-Compaction:** Smart inputs reorganize themselves if you disconnect a source.

## Update Log

### v1.0.3
*   **BUGFIX:** Batch Selector now correctly scales images using 'contain' mode, preventing edge cropping on non-square images (Fixes Issue #3).

### v1.0.2
*   **NEW NODE:** Introduced `Batch Selector`. A powerful replacement for the deprecated Visual Gatekeeper.
*   **REMOVED:** `Visual Gatekeeper` (replaced by Batch Selector).
*   **UI OVERHAUL:** Unified design language across all nodes (Sober/Monochrome aesthetic).
*   **PERFORMANCE:** Native canvas rendering for Batch Selector eliminates HTML overlay issues.
